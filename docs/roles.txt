scripts/animation/path_data.mat

   What goes inside:
move_train.m
    Loads train object
    Defines train path (x,y,z positions)
    Controls movement speed
    Links to VRML nodes (ROUTE commands or vrrotvec)
animate_doors.m
    Controls door opening/closing (rotation or translation)
    Triggered when train arrives
animate_lights.m
    Animated brightness changes
path_data.mat
    Precomputed arrays for train movement (timesteps, coordinates)


Dan Mutisya — Smart Systems (Timetables, Displays, Logic)
FOCUS: Schedules, real-time updates, logic connections
FOLDERS: scripts/systems/ and data/
   Files Person C works on:
data/train_schedule.csv
scripts/systems/timetable.m
scripts/systems/update_display.m
scripts/systems/sync_train_to_schedule.m

   What goes inside:
train_schedule.csv
Columns: TrainID, Arrival, Departure, Destination, Platform
Example:
T001,08:20,08:30,Nairobi,1

timetable.m
Reads CSV file
Converts to timetable object
Calculates next arriving train

update_display.m
Updates VRML 3D text nodes for arrival/departure screens

sync_train_to_schedule.m
Connects schedule timing → train movement timing
Tells animation when to start

   What goes inside:
first_person_navigation.m
    WASD key movement
    Mouse-look movement
    Collision limits (don't walk through walls)
ticket_interaction.m
    Detect click on ticket machine
    Trigger "ticket purchased" display
    Play beep sound
display_interaction.m
    Click to show detailed schedule
    Maybe rotate camera towards screen
